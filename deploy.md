## Why Not Vercel?

Vercel is excellent for:
- Static websites
- Next.js applications
- Serverless functions

But **NOT suitable** for Streamlit apps because:
- ‚ùå No Python runtime support
- ‚ùå No persistent server environment
- ‚ùå Limited WebSocket support
- ‚ùå Execution time limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **API Key Not Working**
   - Make sure the environment variable is set correctly
   - Check that your API key is valid
   - Verify the key has proper permissions

2. **Dependencies Not Installing**
   - Check your `requirements.txt` file
   - Ensure all packages are compatible

3. **App Not Loading**
   - Check the deployment logs
   - Verify the main file path is correct (`app.py`)
